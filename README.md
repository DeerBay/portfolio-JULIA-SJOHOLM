I'm a student at IT-Högskolan, in Gothenburg, Sweden. I am currently studying to become a developer in ai and machine learning. I have previously been involved in IT projects at my current work at the National Archives, but then on the client and claimant side. 
That's what sparked my interest in the IT sector. Within the archives sector, there are many areas that can be developed with the help of AI.

For many years, I have worked in a supervisory role. It has also involved some development and implementation tasks.

My goal in becoming a developer in AI is to be involved in developing tomorrow's technology. Here on GitHub, you will be able to follow my journey there.
